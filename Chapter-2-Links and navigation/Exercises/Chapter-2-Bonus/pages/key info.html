        <h2>Key information</h2>
        <p>
            The key information in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) revolves around several central themes, characters, and events:
            <ol>
                <li>Charlie Bucket: The protagonist, a poor but kind-hearted boy who lives with his family in a small, humble house. Charlie wins the last golden ticket to tour Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.</li> <br>
                <li>Willy Wonka: The eccentric and mysterious owner of the chocolate factory. He is a reclusive genius who has created a magical world inside his factory and is looking for someone to inherit it.</li> <br>
                <li>The Golden Ticket Contest: Willy Wonka hides five golden tickets in chocolate bars, and the lucky finders win the chance to tour his factory. The tickets also come with a grand prize: the opportunity to take over the factory.</li> <br>
                <li>The Other Ticket Winners: Four other children, each with distinct, negative characteristics, are chosen. They are:</li> <br>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Augustus Gloop: A greedy boy who loves eating and is obsessed with chocolate.</li>
                        <li>Veruca Salt: A spoiled and entitled girl who wants everything she sees.</li>
                        <li>Violet Beauregarde: An overly competitive girl who chews gum constantly.</li>
                        <li>Mike Teavee: A boy obsessed with television and technology, ignoring everything else.</li> <br>
                    </ul>

                <li>The Tour of the Factory: The children and their guardians go on a tour of the fantastical chocolate factory, encountering magical rooms, strange inventions, and weird creatures. Each child’s bad behavior leads to their downfall:</li> <br>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Augustus falls into a chocolate river while trying to drink from it.</li>
                        <li>Veruca is deemed a "bad nut" and is thrown down a garbage chute</li>
                        <li>Violet turns violet (literally) after chewing an experimental gum.</li>
                        <li>Mike shrinks down to a tiny size after using a television machine. </li> <br>
                    </ul>
                <li>Moral Lessons: Each child’s fate in the factory serves as a lesson about greed, entitlement, selfishness, and disobedience. Charlie, who remains humble and kind throughout the experience, is the only one who doesn’t fall victim to the factory's dangers. </li> <br>
                <li>Willy Wonka’s Secret: Wonka reveals that he was looking for a worthy heir to take over the factory, and he chooses Charlie because of his goodness and pure heart.</li> <br>
                <li>The Resolution: Charlie and his family are invited to live in the factory, signaling a new and brighter future for them. Charlie’s kindness and family-oriented values ultimately lead him to inherit the chocolate factory, where he and his family begin a new life.</li> <br>
           </ol>
