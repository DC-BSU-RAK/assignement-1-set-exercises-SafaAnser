            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The plot of <i><b>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</b></i> (2005), directed by Tim Burton and based on the classic children's book by Roald Dahl, centers around a young boy named Charlie Bucket. He comes from a poor family and lives in a small house with his parents and four grandparents. 
                One day, the reclusive and eccentric chocolate maker Willy Wonka announces a contest: five golden tickets have been hidden inside his chocolate bars, and whoever finds them will win a tour of his magical, mysterious chocolate factory. Charlie, with the help of his family's love and support, manages to find the last golden ticket, and he is joined by four other children‚Äîeach with their own unique flaws. 
                The tour of the factory reveals strange and wondrous sights, but each of the other children falls victim to their own vices, such as greed, gluttony, and arrogance, resulting in comical but cautionary consequences. Meanwhile, Charlie remains humble and good-hearted throughout the experience. 
                In the end, Willy Wonka reveals that the real purpose of the contest was to find a worthy heir to inherit his factory, and he chooses Charlie because of his pure heart and kindness. Charlie's life changes, and he and his family are invited to live in the factory, where they begin a new chapter of their lives. 
                The film is filled with whimsy, fantasy, and moral lessons about family, humility, and the dangers of excess.</p>

            <h2>Reviews</h2>
            <p>The reviews are taken from Google reviews.</p>
            <p><i>"I love this movie very much. The way Tim Burton directs never fails to impress me, and Johnny Depp acting always be perfect. The insides of the factory are absolutely inspiring, make me want to be like Willy Wonka. I'd suggest you, people, let your children watch this film."</i></p>
            <p><i>"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! this is basically my childhood! To be honest, I dont get why people hate on the actors :/ Like, they can act better than you haters. Honestly, If someone trapped me in a room saying "You can only watch Charlie and The chocolate factory on loop as torture!" I wouldn't really mind üòÇ"</i></p>
            <p><i>"This book is very, very fun book to read -- there is plenty of humor and fun moments. There is NEVER a dull moment in this book. Willy Wonka is a funny, likeable character. Although in this book there are 4 naughty children who gets into mischief and there are consequences for what they've done."</i></p>
            <p><i>"I really liked this film when I first watched. I don't find it as creepy as others do. I can watch it over again. Willy wonka is superb. I have read other comments. someone wrote " willy wonka is creepy and didn't help the drowning child" . Yes, that is correct but he DID warn the child. He should have listened. And all in all he needed to get rid of( sorry for rudeness) spoiled children for the best oneüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"</i></p>
            <p><i>"This movie plays with classic troupes so well that the first third could be an entirely separate movie. The world and character building is done at such a fantastic pace that you're engrossed within the first few minutes of the film. The ending is a little tired but overall this is a fantastic film worthy of your watch."</i></p>
            <p><i>"This movie doesn't have quite the magic that the book has. The Charlie actor did a good job, but at some parts, the actors acted like robots. I also find that the take on Willy Wonka made him seem waaay to dorky and the Oompa Loompas were just plain weird. Neverless, it is still entertaining and enjoyed by kids."</i></p>
            <p><i>"This movie was good but very weird and over the top. Johnny Depp was the perfect person to play "Charlie" in this film though. This is a much more modern and quirky version of "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". If you like the diversity of Johnny Depp and the character's he has played in other film's, then you will love this movie."</i></p>
            <p><i>"this movie is bit below my expectations. The first half is pretty good. But when they get to the factory it allgoes a bit down hill. . Wonka is a bit cringey but ok and the vibe is less whimsical than the book and 1971 version. Overall I prefer the 1971 version. HOWEVER as a stand alone movie, it is alright. If you laugh at the akwardness you are in for a funny movie. If you go in expecting it to be a more serious movie you are not going to have a good time."</i></p>
            <p><i>"Great movie! There is lots of detail and thought put into this movie, and it is very imagitave. Defenetly my favorite move. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and always find details you might not have noticed before."</i></p>
