                <li>Charlie Bucket: The protagonist, a poor but kind-hearted boy who lives with his family in a small, humble house. Charlie wins the last golden ticket to tour Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.</li> <br>
                <li>Willy Wonka: The eccentric and mysterious owner of the chocolate factory. He is a reclusive genius who has created a magical world inside his factory and is looking for someone to inherit it.</li> <br>
                <li>The Golden Ticket Contest: Willy Wonka hides five golden tickets in chocolate bars, and the lucky finders win the chance to tour his factory. The tickets also come with a grand prize: the opportunity to take over the factory.</li> <br>
                <li>The Other Ticket Winners: Four other children, each with distinct, negative characteristics, are chosen. They are:</li> <br>
                
                    <ul> <!-- an unordered list for the four other children and their characteristics -->

                        <li>Violet Beauregarde: An overly competitive girl who chews gum constantly.</li>
                        <li>Mike Teavee: A boy obsessed with television and technology, ignoring everything else.</li> <br>
                    </ul>

                <li>The Tour of the Factory: The children and their guardians go on a tour of the fantastical chocolate factory, encountering magical rooms, strange inventions, and weird creatures. Each child’s bad behavior leads to their downfall:</li> <br>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Augustus falls into a chocolate river while trying to drink from it.</li>
                        <li>Veruca is deemed a "bad nut" and is thrown down a garbage chute</li>

                    </ul>
                <li>Moral Lessons: Each child’s fate in the factory serves as a lesson about greed, entitlement, selfishness, and disobedience. Charlie, who remains humble and kind throughout the experience, is the only one who doesn’t fall victim to the factory's dangers. </li> <br>
