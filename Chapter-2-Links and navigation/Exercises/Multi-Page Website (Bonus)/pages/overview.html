             <!-- this paragraph provides an overview of the movie's plot -->
            <p>The plot of <i><b>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</b></i> (2005), directed by Tim Burton and based on the classic children's book by Roald Dahl, centers around a young boy named Charlie Bucket. He comes from a poor family and lives in a small house with his parents and four grandparents. 
                One day, the reclusive and eccentric chocolate maker Willy Wonka announces a contest: five golden tickets have been hidden inside his chocolate bars, and whoever finds them will win a tour of his magical, mysterious chocolate factory. Charlie, with the help of his family's love and support, manages to find the last golden ticket, and he is joined by four other childrenâ€”each with their own unique flaws. 
                The tour of the factory reveals strange and wondrous sights, but each of the other children falls victim to their own vices, such as greed, gluttony, and arrogance, resulting in comical but cautionary consequences. Meanwhile, Charlie remains humble and good-hearted throughout the experience. 
                In the end, Willy Wonka reveals that the real purpose of the contest was to find a worthy heir to inherit his factory, and he chooses Charlie because of his pure heart and kindness. Charlie's life changes, and he and his family are invited to live in the factory, where they begin a new chapter of their lives. 
                The film is filled with whimsy, fantasy, and moral lessons about family, humility, and the dangers of excess.</p>
