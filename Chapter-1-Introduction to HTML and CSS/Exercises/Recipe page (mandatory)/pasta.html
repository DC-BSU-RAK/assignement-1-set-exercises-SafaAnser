        Pasta is a type of Italian cuisine made from unleavened dough, 
        typically consisting of durum wheat semolina, water, and 
        sometimes eggs. It comes in various shapes, sizes, and forms, 
        each with its own culinary uses. The dough is kneaded, rolled, 
        and cut into different shapes like spaghetti, penne, fusilli, 
        or ravioli. Pasta can be served fresh or dried, and it is often
        boiled before being combined with a variety of sauces, meats, 
        vegetables, or cheeses. Pasta has a long history, with its 
        roots believed to trace back to ancient civilizations such as
        the Etruscans and Romans, but it became most associated with 
        Italian culture during the Middle Ages. The versatility of pasta 
        makes it a staple in many cuisines around the world, not just in 
        Italy. It can be served hot or cold in salads, baked in casseroles,
        or tossed in a rich tomato sauce or creamy Alfredo sauce.
        In addition to its traditional forms, pasta is also available 
        in gluten-free, whole wheat, and other variations to cater to 
        different dietary preferences. It remains one of the most beloved 
        foods globally due to its simplicity, flavor, and ability to pair 
        with a wide array of ingredients.

         <!-- <ol> creates an ordered (numbered) list for the steps -->
    <li>Boil Water: In a large pot, bring plenty of water to a boil. Use about 4-6 quarts (4-6 liters) of water for every 1 pound (450g) of pasta. Adding enough water allows the pasta to cook evenly.</li>

    <li>Add Salt: Once the water is boiling, add about 1-2 tablespoons of salt. This adds flavor to the pasta as it cooks.</li>
    <!-- <ol> creates an ordered (numbered) list for the steps -->
    <li>Add Pasta: Add your chosen pasta to the boiling water. Stir it occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>

    <li>Cook Pasta: Follow the cooking time instructions on the pasta package. Usually, pasta takes 8-12 minutes to cook, depending on the type. For al dente pasta, aim to cook it for a minute or two less than the recommended time. </li>

    <li>Taste Test: Taste a piece of pasta a minute or two before the time is up to make sure it's cooked to your liking (al dente should be firm to the bite).</li>

    <li>Drain Pasta:Once cooked, drain the pasta in a colander. You can save a cup of pasta water to help with the sauce later if needed.</li>

    <li>Serve: You can toss your pasta with sauce or use it in any dish you'd like.</li>
