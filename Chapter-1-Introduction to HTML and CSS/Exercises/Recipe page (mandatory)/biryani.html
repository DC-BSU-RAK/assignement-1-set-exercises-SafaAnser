    <p>
    Biryani is a popular and flavorful dish from South Asia, 
    known for its rich blend of aromatic spices, fragrant rice, 
    and often meat or vegetables. It is a mixed rice dish that 
    originated in the Indian subcontinent, with influences from 
    Persian and Mughal cuisine.
    The base of biryani consists of basmati rice, which is cooked with
    spices like saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, and bay 
    leaves. The rice is usually layered with marinated meat such as 
    chicken, mutton, beef, or fish. For vegetarian versions, a variety
    of vegetables like potatoes, carrots, peas, and beans can be used. 
    The meat or vegetables are often marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and herbs to enhance the flavors.
    The biryani is then cooked using one of two main methods: the 
    "Kacchi" style, where raw marinated meat is layered with partially 
    cooked rice and slow-cooked, or the "Pakki" style, where both the 
    meat and rice are cooked separately and then combined.
    Biryani is often served with side dishes such as raita (yogurt-based dip), 
    salad, or a boiled egg. Its combination of spices and textures makes 
    it a comforting, festive dish loved by many people worldwide. There 
    are regional variations of biryani, such as Hyderabadi biryani, 
    Kolkata biryani, and Malabar biryani, each with its own unique twist 
    on the recipe.

    <h2 style="color: rgb(168, 95, 95);"><u>Instructions</u></h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b>
                In a large bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt.
                Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or for a few hours if you have time for better flavor).</li> <br> <br>
            
            <li><b>Cook the Rice: </b> 
                Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
                Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Add bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, salt, and a little ghee.
                Add the rinsed rice and cook for about 7-8 minutes, or until the rice is about 70-80% cooked (the grains should still be firm).
                Drain the rice and set it aside.</li> <br> <br>
                
            <li><b> Prepare the Biryani Base: </b> 
                In a large pot or deep pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil.
                Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions for garnishing later.
                Add the ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies to the remaining onions, and sauté for a minute until fragrant.
                Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.
                Stir in the coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the spices to blend and release their flavors.</li> <br> <br>
            
            <li><b>Cook the Marinated Chicken: </b>  
                Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook on medium heat for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
                Add the fresh coriander and mint leaves, and stir to combine.</li> <br> <br>
            
            <li><b> Layering the Biryani:</b> 
                In the same pot, spread half of the cooked rice over the chicken mixture.
                Drizzle half of the saffron milk (if using) over the rice for added color and fragrance.
                Add the remaining rice as the second layer on top of the chicken mixture.
                Drizzle the rest of the saffron milk, and top with the reserved fried onions, fresh coriander, and mint leaves.</li> <br> <br>
            
            <li><b>Cook the Biryani: </b> 
                Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid to trap the steam. You can also place a heavy object on the lid to ensure it stays sealed.
                Cook the biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together (this is known as dum cooking).
                If you're using a pressure cooker, cook on low heat without the pressure for about 15-20 minutes.</li> <br> <br>
                
            <li><b> Serve: </b> 
                Once done, remove from heat and let the biryani sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.
                Gently fluff the rice with a fork, mixing the chicken and rice together.
                Serve hot with raita (yogurt-based side dish), salad, or boiled eggs.</li> <br> <br>
                
                <b> Tips: </b><br>
                You can also add dried fruits like raisins or nuts like cashews and almonds to the biryani for extra richness.
                Adjust the spice levels to your preference by increasing or decreasing the green chilies and chili powder.
                Always use basmati rice for a long-grain texture and fragrance.<br>
                Enjoy your homemade Chicken Biryani! It’s perfect for any special occasion or a satisfying family meal.
